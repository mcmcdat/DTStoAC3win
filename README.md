# DTStoAC3win
Script to convert audio for MKV files from DTS to AC3 through system commands within Windows. Many TVs do not support DTS encoding (e.g., LG), meaning that some videos are unable to play.

This script currently only works for Windows, but the system commands and paths can be modified for other operating systems.
